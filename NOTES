Maybe there is no use attaching the image to the object because you have to get the image directly from the dom anyways

There doesn't be a good palce to mark when a pawn's first move has been taken

Maybe create a hash that contains relationship better squares and pieces

Don't think I need the hash that relates piece names to piece objects; i can go through the square name to get to the piece object and when I click on piece i can get the id of the containing square
