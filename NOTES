Maybe there is no use attaching the image to the object because you have to get the image directly from the dom anyways

There doesn't be a good palce to mark when a pawn's first move has been taken

Maybe create a hash that contains relationship better squares and pieces

Don't think I need the hash that relates piece names to piece objects; i can go through the square name to get to the piece object and when I click on piece i can get the id of the containing square

It's possible i don't even have to check isOnBoard for the pawn because the movement of conditions already put on the pieces

Is capture piece in the right place?

Where do dead pieces go from the dictionary?

Is there some way to shore up the way the knight is working in the getPossiblePositions

Bishop negative slope if somewhat more complicated than the positive slope

Why naming is the hardest part of programming...the idea that there is no way to abstract away naming

Consistency with rook and bishop
